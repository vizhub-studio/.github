## Open Source Projects

This organization hosts the open-source components that make VizHub possible:

- **`vzcode`**  
  An in-browser code editor for data visualization, built on  
  [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) and [ShareDB](https://share.github.io/sharedb/) for real-time collaboration.

- **`vizhub-runtime`**  
  A secure sandbox for executing and rendering visualizations, built on  
  [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Sucrase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sucrase).

- **`editcodewithai`**  
  A one-shot, LLM-driven source code editing tool used to power AI-assisted workflows.

These projects are designed to be useful independently, and are also composed together in VizHub’s hosted products.

## Why Open Source?

VizHub is built in the open because data visualization is both a **craft** and a **teaching discipline**.

Open source enables:
- Learning by reading real, production code
- Reuse across frameworks and environments
- Long-term sustainability beyond any single product
- Community contributions that improve the ecosystem for everyone
